# A-simple-python-web-server-running-on-a-ubuntu-docker-image

This application runs a simple python web server on a ubuntu docker image. The web server uses redis to store the number of visits. In this case, the redis server has to be run somewhere. There are two ways to accomplish this. First, it can be run on the same ubuntu docker image. However, a Docker container cannot run two commands at the same time, so after runing the web server, we have to open another terminal to execute the same docker and launch redis server on it. More seriously, the ubuntu image has to run with root user in order to start the redis-server which might have security issues. Second, we can use redis docker image and link to it in the web server application. The second way is simple and safe.
